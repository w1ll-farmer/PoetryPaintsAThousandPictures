{"You are the person who broke my heart,\nThe person who stole it died months gone past.\nYou took her place, sharing the same face, \nHiding another I couldn't see.\n\nI wrote you songs, though I couldn't sing - \nAnd yet I sang for you.\nYou made me laugh and smile and dream of tomorrow,\nBut now tomorrow is just another day without you.\n\nWhen the morning mist descends,\nAnd the sunlight seeps through the cracks in my fragmented window,\nThe wind whistles through and awake me tenderly,\nJust like you used to do,\nBefore you were just an echo of yesterday.\n\nAnd now we are strangers again,\nLike we were that day by the pool,\nLike we stopped being that night by the hammocks,\nBut now we're strangers with memories;\nMemories I know in time I'll forget,\nBut time is cruel and deceiving,\nBut then, I suppose, so were you":"Will Farmer","Love comes quietly,\nfinally, drops\nabout me, on me,\nin the old ways.\n\nWhat did I know\nthinking myself \nable to go\nalone all the way.":"Robert Creeley","Though society frowned up on our love,\nOur emotions aren't limited by Law,\nBut a gift bestowed from He up above.\nYou, the purest creature I ever saw,\nGave love to a damaged wreck such as I.\nWhile little love you received in return,\nYou became my steadfast, constant ally.\nFor no greater love I will ever yearn,\nFor you are one too pure to ever forget,\nAnd on a lonely night I reminisce,\nOf how grateful I really am we met,\nI lie and think about how much I miss\nThe love I felt for you, the truest kind,\nThe kind that show some love is truly blind.
