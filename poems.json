{"You are the person who broke my heart,\nThe person who stole it died months gone past.\nYou took her place, sharing the same face, \nHiding another I couldn't see.\n\nI wrote you songs, though I couldn't sing - \nAnd yet I sang for you.\nYou made me laugh and smile and dream of tomorrow,\nBut now tomorrow is just another day without you.\n\nWhen the morning mist descends,\nAnd the sunlight seeps through the cracks in my fragmented window,\nThe wind whistles through and awake me tenderly,\nJust like you used to do,\nBefore you were just an echo of yesterday.\n\nAnd now we are strangers again,\nLike we were that day by the pool,\nLike we stopped being that night by the hammocks,\nBut now we're strangers with memories;\nMemories I know in time I'll forget,\nBut time is cruel and deceiving,\nBut then, I suppose, so were you":"Will Farmer","Love comes quietly,\nfinally, drops\nabout me, on me,\nin the old ways.\n\nWhat did I know\nthinking myself \nable to go\nalone all the way.":"Robert Creeley"}
