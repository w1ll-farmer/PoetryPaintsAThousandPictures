This is my first summative coursework for programming black. 

I aim to create a single-page app (SPA) that (at time of submission) will allow users to enter poems and their authors, as well as read other people's submissions.

Post-submission, i intend to further the website so that it allows people to create accounts, like poems and comment on them too.
