            Poetry Paints a thousand Pictures
        </h1>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Poetry. The foundation of modern creativity. What else could tell a story, sing a song, describe emotions to vivid and complex? Nothing.

            To help bring poetry to the wider world, I have created this platform, for those to submit their own works, and for others to read. Readers are able to comment on and like poems in order to help aspiring poets to improve. To start writing a poem, simply type it into the box below.
